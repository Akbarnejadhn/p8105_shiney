```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}

shiny::runExample("01_hello")
```

R should be installed in the place that shiny is run! Sho, sharing it is a little tricky.
should put it somewhere poeple can acess it, but that is also tricky...
if producing shiny for a small group of people with the same skillset, it is easy to share.
putting it on github regularly not gonna work.
shineyapps.io is common!

```{r}


```
